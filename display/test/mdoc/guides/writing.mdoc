# Writing a mdoc - Essentials

## Create a mdoc/ directory at the root of a Git project
Simply create a mdoc/ directory at the root of your Git project.

## Add the Meta file
The meta file, which exists at "mdoc/meta" contains metadata that is used to
setup your site.

This file is written in YAML format and provides the following:

* Name of the site, which is used in the site banner
* The site style that will be used. "base" is the default style
* Banner links that will be included
* Menus that will be setup in the banner (future)

Here is an example meta file that is used for this site:

```
name: MDOC
style: base
links:
- name: Writing A Document
  url: guides/writing.mdoc
- name: Creating A Style
  url: guides/styles.mdoc
- name: Owners
  url: owners/owners.mdoc
- name: Authors
  url: authors/authors.mdoc
```

## Add an index file as the main landing page
Add a file, mdoc/index.mdoc .  This page is written in markdown format and will
contain the landing page when people navigate to your page.
